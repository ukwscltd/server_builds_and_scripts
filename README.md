# server_builds_and_scripts
A collection of server builds and useful bash scripts, this is not a software project merely a collection of information to keep all my notes in one place. Some of these scripts can be very dangerous to run in a live environment with websites already running so please read the instructions carefully, most of the management scripts are intended to be used from when the server is created and not retrofitted. That said you use all of these scripts at your own risk and I am not responsible for any loss of data.
